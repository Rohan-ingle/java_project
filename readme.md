## Description

This project implements a secure file transfer system using AES encryption in Java. It leverages the concepts of Interfaces, Abstraction, and Inheritance for better code management, making the system modular and easily extensible.

## Features

- **Secure File Transfer**: Utilizes AES encryption to ensure the security of file transfers.
- **Modular Design**: Implements Interfaces and Abstract classes to ensure a clean and manageable codebase.
- **Extensible**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy updates and addition of new features.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: JDK 8 or higher is required to run this project.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans is recommended for development, although not strictly necessary.
- **Understanding of Cryptography**: Basic knowledge of symmetric encryption and key management is beneficial.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install JDK**: Ensure that you have a compatible version of the JDK installed. You can download the latest version from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone Rohan-ingle/java_project
    ```

3. **Prepare Client and Server**: Before running the application, ensure that the necessary files are in place:
    - **On the Client Side**: Place the `FileSender.java`, `FileOperator.java`, `Encryptable.java`, `AESEncryptor.java` and any files you wish to transfer in your client directory. Ensure the `RandomKeyGenerator.java` has been run at least once to generate the `key.txt` file.
    - **On the Server Side**: Ensure the `FileReceiver.java`, `FileOperator.java`, `Encryptable.java`, `AESEncryptor.java`  is ready in your server directory. The `key.txt` file generated by the client should be copied here if the server is on a different machine.

4. **Open and Run**: 
    - **Server**: Open the project in your IDE, navigate to the `FileReceiver.java`, and run it to start the server.
    - **Client**: Run the `FileSender.java` class to start sending files to your server.

## Usage

To use this project for file transfer:

1. **Generate Encryption Key**: Run the `RandomKeyGenerator` class to generate a new encryption key.
2. **Start the File Receiver**: Run the `FileReceiver` class on the receiving end.
3. **Send Files**: Use the `FileSender` class to send files securely to the receiver.
